Routing

Routing Convention
    1. all routes must live inside the app folder
    2. route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
    3. each folder represents a segment of the url path

    when these convestions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as route

    eg 1. when user visits localhost:3000, home page is visible


when we try to run the above scenario, layout.tsx is automatically created. next.js creates it when you first time access the route. this file is automatically created in the background.

    eg 2. localhost:3000/about and localhost:3000/profile

    create folder inside app folder: about
    page.tsx inside the about. thats all


    eg 3. localhost:3000/blog/first and localhost:3000/blog/second
